# Selection Sort Visualization

This is a JavaFX application that demonstrates the Selection Sort algorithm visually. The application allows you to see the step-by-step sorting process of an array of random numbers.

## Getting Started

To run the application, you need to have Java and JavaFX installed on your system. Follow the steps below to get started:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/Lelokarma/Selection_Sort-Visualization.git

2. Make sure you have Java and JavaFX installed on your system. If not, you can download and install them from the following links:
- Java Development Kit (JDK): [https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
- JavaFX: [https://openjfx.io/](https://openjfx.io/)

3. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).

4. Build and run the `SelectionSort` class, which contains the `main` method.

## Usage

Once you run the application, you will see a window with a "Start" button and a "Close" button. Follow these steps to use the application:

1. Click the "Start" button to start the sorting process.
2. The application will generate a random array of numbers and display them on the screen.
3. The sorting process will begin, and you will see the visualization of the algorithm step by step.
4. Once the sorting is complete, an alert will be displayed, indicating that the sorting process is finished.
5. You can click the "Close" button to exit the application.
